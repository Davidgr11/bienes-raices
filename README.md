# Real Estate MVC üè°

Real Estate MVC is a web application designed for property management, allowing users to publish, manage, and search for real estate listings efficiently and securely. The project is built following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern, which ensures scalability, maintainability, and clean code organization.

## Project Overview

The platform allows users to:
- Register and authenticate securely.
- Publish new properties with images and relevant details.
- Edit, delete, and manage their own properties.
- Search for properties using various filters (category, price, location, etc.).
- Send and receive messages related to properties.

The system is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and secure, integrating modern web development best practices and a user-friendly experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js, used for routing and HTTP request handling.
